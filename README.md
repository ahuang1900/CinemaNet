# CinemaNet
Cinematic Shot type data set with data, labels, conversion scripts for Tensorflow to TFRecord format.


Early stages of a data set of neural network classification of various cinematic shot type / taxonomies.

Currently exploring taxonomies for:

### Framing
* Close Up
* Extreme Close Up
* Extreme Long Shot
* Long Shot
* Medium

Need more data for: 

## Type
* Master
* Two Up
* Over the Shoulder

Need any data for: 

## Angle
* Aerial
* High
* Low
* Tilted


Currently grabbing data from the web - citing fair use for building models. If you see your a frame you dont want me to use, tell me, and i' might not tell you to fuck off.
